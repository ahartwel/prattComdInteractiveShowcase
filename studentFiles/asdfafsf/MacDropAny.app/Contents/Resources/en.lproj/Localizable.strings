	<string>By default, Apple doesn't provide you with any way to keep your own files in your iCloud account. iClouDrive, an app created by Zibity (the developer of MacDropAny), allows you to use your iCloud storage space in a way similar to other online storage providers.
	
To use iClouDrive with MacDropAny, you must have already downloaded and installed iClouDrive. It does not appear that you have done this yet.</string>

	<string>I love making apps for you to use, but they do take quite a lot of time and effort to build and maintain. I first created MacDropAny back in January of 2011, when I was 13 years old. Since then, it's been used over 160,000 times by people all around the world. I've spent hundreds of hours keeping it up to date and helping users.

MacDropAny has always been free, and I am committed to keeping it that way, but this is only sustainable for me if enough users make donations.

If you can spare it, I'd be very thankful if you donated some money to help keep my servers online!

Thanks,
Sebastian (15 year old developer of MacDropAny)</string>
